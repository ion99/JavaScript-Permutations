# JavaScript-Permutations

In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of arranging all the members of a set into some sequence or order rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting. 

The number of permutations of 'n' distinct objects is 'n factorial' ---> n!, the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

# Examples:

Array ['a', 'b', 'c'] permutations:

[ [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ],
  [ 'a', 'c', 'b' ],
  [ 'b', 'a', 'c' ],
  [ 'b', 'c', 'a' ],
  [ 'c', 'a', 'b' ],
  [ 'c', 'b', 'a' ] ];


String ['abc'] permutations:

[ 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba' ];
